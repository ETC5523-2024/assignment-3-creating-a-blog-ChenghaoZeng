I am a graduate student specializing in Business Analytics at Monash University, with a background in Finance and IT. I have gained valuable industry experience through internships at CSC Financial and E Fund Management, where I focused on applying data-driven approaches to finance and business operations. 

I am passionate about solving complex business problems using data analysis and visualization techniques. I have an active GitHub profile which contains most of my research code that can be made publicly available.
